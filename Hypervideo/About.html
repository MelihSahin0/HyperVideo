                       Hello, we are Amir, Melih and Muhi. We are art enthusiasts who were always displeased
                       with the way most art museums display their work online. Either its the we give you all paintings at once
                       hope you find one you like or list of them making you fall asleep after a feq minutes. To combat this problem
                       we made our way across the globe capturing video after video, museum after museum with the aim of helping you enjoy
                       a museum online instead of making the journey there and then be dissapointed. All of these trips were pretty expensive,
                       so don't be shy and donate a penny.

                    </p>
